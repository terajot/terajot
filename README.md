# Terajot  -_Your personal log re-imagined_
________
Terajot is a notebook for the CLI enthusiast. It aims to
**get out of your way so you can capture thoughts.**

 Most note taking apps are feature rich and allow you to organize your thouhgts in anyway you want. Terajot purposly takes the opposite approach.

 It is an opinionated and minimalistic way of organizing data.

A note in Terajot is called an **Entry** and they are organized into **Stacks**

An Entry can be as long or as short as you want. From a simple phone number to a complete journal.

Stacks simply organize Entries by date.

## Background
This project started becuase I was nevr able to replicate my paper workflow using exisitng tools.

The abundance of tags, categories, titles, backlinks, plugins, etc... left me trying to organize notes over using the tool. I wanted something simple. I wanted something fast.Most of all, I wanted the tool to get out of my way and let me capture a random thought without having to think about how to organize it.

With that in mind, I also figured it would be a good opportunity to learn a new programming language. One evening later, I had a rough POC.

This project is intended to be for my personal use, but I'd love if you joined me - whether you want to use it, or even contribute code or even just ideas.
